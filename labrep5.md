### ***Part 1 (Scenario)***
hello

### ***Part 2 (Reflection)***
In terms of technical knowledge, I've learned a lot of neat tricks from being in labs. Learning how to use tools like vim, bash, and servers in class is useful, <br/>
but learning how to use them more efficiently came from labs, where we explored a lot of shortcuts (mostly from the internet) to imitate a real working environment. <br/>
