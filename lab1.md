## ***Purpose:***
The goal of this lab was to introduce ourselves to using SSH, navigating through terminal, and GitHub to creare content. 

## ***How did it go?***
1. Resetting password for CSE15L account: ![Reset Tool](pwResetSS.png)
<sub>I reset my password before class, and it went pretty smoothly.</sub>

2. Starting up VSCode and opening a terminal: ![VSCode](vscodeSS.png)
3. Successfully logging into SSH through *ieng6* client (*not sure if this is the right terminology?*): ![SSH](SSH Login.png)
