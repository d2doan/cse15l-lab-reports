# Lab Report 4
___
*Date: 5/18/23*

## **Purpose:**
To explore and practice commands in terminal, using vim to edit and manipulate text/code, and interact with GitHub through git.<br/>

## **Procedure/How Did It Go?**
Log into your student account via ieng6. After setting up an SSH key, the log-in process should be fairly quick.<br/>
<br/>
If you need a reminder, to login, type `$ ssh cs15lsp23__@ieng6.ucsd.edu` in your terminal and press `enter` until you are successfully in your student account.<br/>
<br>

<br/>
Assuming the https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-sp23/lab7 repository is forked into your personal GitHub account, run the command `$ git clone git@github.com:user/repositoryName.git` + `enter`.
